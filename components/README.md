# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://www.nuxtjs.cn/api/configuration-components) and  [the documentation](https://github.com/nuxt/components).
